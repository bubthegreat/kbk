Those who follow Deomanix are known as the Seekers of Infinity.  Deomanix
is magic, he created it, and is one with it.  There can be no Magic without
him.  Magic is outside of time, only when wielded by mortals are limitations
put upon it.  Followers who seek the mark of Infintate Tome know that it is
only by the feeble mind of most mortals that magic finds its limits.  They
seek to free thier mind andgather as much knowledge as possible so they may
know the true power availible to them.  Deomanix is also the Lord of the
Tower of the Five Magics, he therefore holds to the ideals of the Tower as
well.

rescued from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards
carved and painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some
musical or other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the
wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window
looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock
and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south
returns you to Austral Square.
On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing
a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time for your arrival
