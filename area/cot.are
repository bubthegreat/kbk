You are in a small room.  You dont see anything out of the ordinary
except for a small lever on the northern wall.  Before you can do anything,
a little imp runs up to the level and grabs it, sending a large stone
crashing in front of the door way you had just came through.  A hatch on the
bottom of the floor opens up.  You realize that this is your only way out of
this room.

Candles adorn the walls allowing a low light to be cast upon the treasures in the room.
