#HELPS

0 CHANGES~
There may be changes other than these that the Immortal Staff wishes to
keep under wraps. These are only the changes the Staff wishes to reveal to mortals.

Zor - 2009-05-04: Mana/move drain component of plague reduced by 50%. Regeneration-cutting 
                  component of plague reduced by 50%. Strength reduction per stack changed to
                  -3, from -5. Energy drain HP drain increased by 100%, mana drain increased 
                  by 50%, and move drain increased by 50%. Fatigue move reduction reduced from 
                  50% of remaining mv to a significantly smaller number equivalent to an
                  energy drain targeted at moves.
Zor - 2009-05-04: Cabal outer and inner guardians have been weakened. More tweaking likely
                  as we move forward.
Zor - 2009-05-03: Armor Class and Weight of items have been changed to functions of material 
                  and item level as opposed to randomly selected values by builders before. 
                  Reaching higher armor values should be easier now. Items made of heavier 
                  materials (e.g. metals) will be significantly heavier than light 
                  materials (e.g. cloth).
Zor - 2009-05-02: Unholy Bless back in for Anti-Paladins. Executioners Grace removed.
Zor - 2009-05-02: Restoration now cures rot. This applies to the healer in Midgaard 
                  as well as the healer class spell.
Zor - 2009-05-02: Fireball and iceball should now work properly.
Zor - 2009-05-02: Effects which can be stacked (i.e. poison, plague) will no longer stack
                  beyond 20 hours duration. Other effects such as strength loss will continue
                  to stack indefinitely despite the duration being capped.
Zor - 2009-05-02: Dispellable effects (i.e. blind, poison, plague, etc.) can now have at MOST
                  an 80% chance to prevent dispel, down from 99%. To compensate, however, they 
                  also now have at LEAST a 20% chance to prevent dispel, up from 5%.
Zor - 2009-04-29: Dam_mod is now capped at 80% damage reduced. 
Zor - 2009-04-27: New skill STANCE for rangers. See HELP STANCE for info.
Zor - 2009-04-27: BALL LIGHTNING for elementalists reimplemented, and is now a groupwide
                  area of effect spell.  Elementalist quest rewards added, including
                  BASTION OF ELEMENTS, VORPAL BOLT, HURRICANE, ELEMENTAL AFFINITY, MAELSTROM,
                  and SHATTER ARMOR.
Zor - 2009-04-27: Gold should be a little easier to get now. The tougher the mob, the more
                  gold.
Zor - 2009-04-24: Fixed a bug involving players being renamed suddenly and without warning.
Zor - 2009-04-23: Ofcol, New Thalos, Arkham, and Tar Valon are now protected cities,
                  in addition to Midgaard. This means Enforcers will have full use
                  of their abilities in these areas.
Zor - 2009-04-23: Hitroll and Armor Class (AC) now play a much larger part in
                  combat. SCORE command updated to reflect new AC / damage
                  reduction system.
Zor - 2009-04-23: Output for defensive skills updated to be more descriptive.
Zor - 2009-04-23: Bounty commands are now active. Regeneration updated and made
                  visible to players, and can now be addressed with equipment. 
Zor - 2009-04-22: Healer quest rewards added, including skills RESURRECT, BULWARK OF BLADES,
                  BLADE MASTERY, COALESCE RESISTANCE, DIVINE TRANSFERRANCE, GROUP SANCTUARY,
                  GROUP GATE, and GROUP RECALL. 
Zor - 2009-04-20: Channeler and Thief quest rewards added, including skills MANA SHIELD,
                  MANA DISRUPTION, MENTAL CLARITY, MANA CONDUIT, DOUBLECAST, DISGUISE,
                  SHADOWSTEP, PLANT EXPLOSIVE, ADVANCED TRIPWIRE, and IMPROVED BLACKJACK.
Zor - 2009-04-19: GLOBE OF DARKNESS fixed, and will eventually wear off affected
                  room when cast.
Zor - 2009-04-19: Objects "owned" by a character, such as Leader weapons, will
                  stay with their owner through death.
Tra - 2009-04-18: STAB and GOUGE updated to address game balance.
Zor - 2009-05-06: Skill improvement rates increased.
Zor - 2009-05-05: Necromancers gain Banshee Call. Cooldown on dark summons reduced from 60 to 10.
                  Members of Ancient can now target each other by name while cloaked.
Tra - 2009-05-05: Channelers have lost Sanctuary and gained Ward of Magnetism.
Zor - 2009-05-05: Zealots lose Turn Undead. Good-aligned turn undead now causes undead NPCs
                  in the room to run for the hills. Zealot Sanctuary replaced with Aura, which
                  is only 30% damage reduction as opposed to 50%.
Zor - 2009-05-05: Dexterity plays a more significant role in dodging, as well as unarmed defense for
                  assassins. This is to compensate for the HP disparity between dextrous and
                  strong races. Ironhands is no longer infallible and strength is now a major
                  factor in its success. 
Zor - 2009-05-04: The channeler spell Animate Object has been overhauled. Animated weapons now
                  deal special attacks based on weapon type. Animated armor is more protective
                  of its owner...
Zor - 2009-05-04: Atrophy degeneration increased to -10 from roughly -4. Regeneration
                  (whether from gear, imbue regeneration, or atrophy) now affects mana and 
                  moves as well as HP, at a rate of half the character's regen stat.

0 MOTD~
Welcome to KBK Reborn!

2018-09-17:  Bub the Great resurrects the old code.  KBK is a mindless zombie and stinks.
----------:  Lots of fixes and improvements, thanks to Krunk - but MOTD is long, snip.
2023-01-17:  Improvements to score and some bug fixes.

52 IMOTD~
Welcome Immortal! 

Item base AC values have been changed to a live calculation at startup based on the 
material properties and item level. This means that the OLC v0-v3 for armor types is 
useless for now. If you want to add AC to an item, use addaffect ac. Hardcoded v0-v3
values in OLC will be overwritten when the MUD next starts up.

Object materials are now restricted to a selection of 30-something predefined materials,
in preparation for a more robust and interactive materials system. See materials.lst in
area/

{G** If you intend on building, read HELP OLC to make sure the item balance we're
trying to promote isn't disturbed. **{x

~

0 NEWBIE~
Welcome to Kill or be Killed

If you are a new player here, this helpfile will outline the basics
of getting started on KBK.

As you no doubt have noticed, you created a character and have found yourself
on level 51. To those who are unaware, 51 is the highest mortal level attainable.
The purpose of KBK is to promote a pure PK environment, enhanced by several
features, a large world, and much to strive for. 

After reading this helpfile, you may want to type 'help' and view some of the 
suggested helpfiles for information not covered in this helpfile.
{y(See: 'help'){x

Upon creating a character, you are given three hours, during which you may not attack
or be attacked by any mortal characters. You are in a 'Ghost' status, which prevents
mobs from attacking you as well. However, note that if during any of these hours you
decide to join a Cabal (outlined later in this helpfile), you will lose your newbie
status, and soon after, your Ghost status. 

Begin by typing 'outfit', which will grant you a set of basic equipment to start with.
{y(See also: 'help outfit'){x

During your three newbie hours, you should attempt to accomplish a few tasks in 
preparation for entering PK, listed here in order of highest priority:

{G*{x Practice and perfect your class's important skills and spells. While a newbie,
  you have access to the practice dummy, which can normally be found 3 south, 3 west,
  3 south, and east from RECALL. If the dummy is not to be found, ask another player
  or Immortal to locate it for you.

{G*{x Join a Cabal. Cabals are organizations of players that strive for certain
  causes, such as protection or roleplaying.
  {y(See also: 'help cabal'){x

{G*{x Acquire a suitable set of equipment. Some players may assist you in this
  endeavor, if they're willing.

{G*{x Learn the basic layout of the MUD. Important areas, such as cabal hideouts,
  are covered in 'help eastern thera' and 'help western thera'. It is absolutely
  imperative that you learn the locations of cabals if you intend to join one. Other
  areas of importance are shown in the maps as well.
  {y(See: 'help eastern thera' and 'help western thera'){x

If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to contact an Immortal for
further assistance.

~

0 GOLD MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold coinage. Gold can be obtained from
any number of places.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

0 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly 
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

52 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
recall.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).
~

0 PROMPT~
Help information from PROMPT command can be viewed by typing PROMPT.
~

0 SUMMARY~
For help on a specific topic, type 'help <topic>' for any 
command, skill, or spell.

Suggested helpfiles: 'NEWBIE' 'COMMUNICATION' 'WHO' 'DEATH' 'CABAL' 
                     'SPECIALIZATION' 'WIZLIST' 'PK' 'CLASSES' 'RACES'
~

0 COMMUNICATION~
There are many forms of communication between players.

See also: 'SAY' 'GTELL' 'YELL' 'TELL' 'REPLY' 'PRAY' 'WHISPER'
          'EMOTE' 
~

0 GTELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>

GTELL sends a message to all of the characters in your group, 
wherever they are, even if they are sleeping or stunned or dying.  
';' is a synonym for GTELL.
~

0 TELL REPLY~
Syntax: tell <character> <message>
	reply <message>

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY 
will work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their 
identity.  This is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal 
players.
~

0 WHISPER~
Syntax: whisper <message>

WHISPER sends a message to all awake players in your room. This form
of communication prevents revealing yourself while hidden, while SAY does
not.
~

0 SAY~
Syntax: say <message>

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single 
quote ''' is a synonym for SAY.
~

0 PRAY~
Syntax: pray <message>

This channel may be used to communicate specifically with the Immortals.
This command should not be used for menial requests and should be reserved
for issues of importance.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of your
chosen hometown. Your corpse is left behind in the room you were killed
in, together with all of you equipment.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

Corpses decay after time, and if they do any items inside them will be
returned to the pit of the hometown you recall to. Player corpses last
*roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
Be warned: Anyone may loot anyone else's corpse.

If you die 4 times you will lose 1 point of constitution. Should you be
reduced to less than 3 constitution you will collapse and expire
premenantly...have that final goodbye note ready.

See also: 'AGE'
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN DIRECTION~
Syntax: north
	south
	east
	west
	up
	down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in. 
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT~

	drop <amount> coins
	get  <object>
	get  <object> <container>
	give <object> <character>
	give <amount> coins <character>
	put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

Syntax: equipment
	inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object0> <object-2>
	compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
Compare doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE. There are other methods of
escaping harm in combat.

See also: 'RESCUE' 'WORD OF RECALL'
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK~
Syntax: look    <object/character/direction>
	look
	look in <container/corpse>
	examine <container/corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see. LOOK without an
argument shows you the room you are standing in. LOOK IN shows you
the objects contained in a container. EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' 
followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
	order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform a command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly. Some commands
can not be given to followers as an order.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
	sleep
	stand
	wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

0 EMOTE PMOTE SMOTE POSE SOCIAL~
Syntax: emote <action>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

SMOTE works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold <object>
	remove <object>

(as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a 
magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the nature of the 
scroll.  ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target.  If the target is not 
specified, and you are fighting someone, then that character is used as 
the target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

Consider tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it is only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
	group
	group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

0 VISIBLE~
Syntax: visible

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT SAVE~
Syntax: quit
	save

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 5 seconds, so use it sparingly.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: recall
	/

RECALL prays to the Immortals for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the your hometown.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL. Only characters in their
newbie hours may use Recall freely.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.

See also: 'WORD OF RECALL' 'CURSE'
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: split <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  
Example:
split 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: practice
Syntax: practice <skill|spell>

Practice without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

Practice with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to 75%. You can practice anywhere.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str/int/wis/dex/con/hp/mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes anywhere.

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10. 
~

60 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

60 PROGSET~
Syntax: progset <obj/mob/room> <vnum> <prog-type> <prog-name>

PROGSET assigns hardcoded special programs to objects, mobiles, or rooms.
These programs are triggered by specific events and allow for custom behavior

~

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow <site>
	ban <site> <newbies/all/permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or 
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidentally lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.
~

59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 51), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

59 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

57 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

57 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

53 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 57 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example. 

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

56 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

56 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

58 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

55 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

57 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

56 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~

56 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

57 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

55 TRANSFER TELEPORT~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~

54 ARENA~
Syntax: arena

ARENA is a toggle command that starts or stops a global arena event. When
activated, all non-newbie players are automatically transported to the arena
for a free-for-all combat event.

When Arena Mode Starts:
- All players (except newbies) are teleported to the arena
- Mortals go to room 26000, immortals to room 26060
- Players are set to ghost mode (no death penalties)
- Wizlock is automatically enabled (prevents new logins)
- Normal cabal, class, and alignment politics are suspended
- Players fight to collect arena trophies from kills
- Death returns you to the altar with all equipment intact

When Arena Mode Ends:
- All players are returned to their recall points
- Mortals return to room 3014, immortals to room 1200
- Arena trophies are counted and results are announced
- Trophies are removed from inventory
- Wizlock is automatically disabled
- Kill counts are displayed for all participants

Notes:
- This is a major server event affecting all players
- Should be announced in advance when possible
- Newbie characters are automatically excluded
- The arena is a consequence-free PK environment
- Prizes may be awarded to top performers

~

54 AT~
Syntax: at <location> <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).
~

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

52 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally 
invisible.
~

52 INCOGNITO~
Syntax: incognito <level>
	incognito

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

52 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

56 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

53 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob <name>
	stat obj <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

53 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

55 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

52 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~

55 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log <character>
	log all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~

54 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
~

51 IMMTALK :~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

52 WIZNET~
Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~

51 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

Wizhelp provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

strength.

opponents.

See also: 'RECALL' 'WORD OF RECALL'
~

0 'DETECT EVIL'~

~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~
Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast cancellation <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast earthquake

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!
~

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the
weapon grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or
destroyed by the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level
of the weapon by one...and there is no turning back.
~

0 'ENCHANT ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant armor' <armor>

The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics. It is
not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive
effects.  Each succesful enchant increases the plus of the armor by 1 or 2
points, and raises its level by one.
~

0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~

0 TARTARUS~
Tartarus code was started in late 1996 and completed around mid 1997. It
was developed at darkmists.mudservices.com for use on the mud Dark Mists
and used Rom2.4b3 code. The original coder on the mud was Thrym who
began the mud with Styx, who contributed ideas and help. Ceran joined
the team and contributed most of the core code, including all the class
and clan skills/spells as well as the majority of fully new code, before
leaving in 1997 because of conflicts with the other immortals.

This code release is named Tartarus and contains Ceran's original coding
plus rewritten code. This code is for use on Rom2.4b muds, although it can
be easily hacked for parts to use on other code bases. It is provided
solely for the MUDing community as a way of giving back to it what has
been freely given many times before.
The following people contributed to the Tartarus release:

Code --
	Thrym who installed the MOBProgs patch into the base ROM code.

Areas --
	-Lilith (Arkham) (Unable to contact this person. See 
         README.tararus file which comes with this derivative code)
	-Kay, who wrote a lot of Nightfall and Thorbardin.
	-Zenan, who did Rakshasa Domain when I got bogged down with code
         and other areas.

52 COMMANDMENTS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.

		=== Commandments of Thera ===
		
These rules apply to all Immortals.

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
    Any immortal found killing a mortal will be deleted.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs, handing out equipment.
    
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly

4)  DO NOT use reboot unless you have a very good reason.

5)  Do not induct anyone into a clan just because they ask. Clans grant 
    special abilities and are a reward for good playing.

6)  Do NOT create and keep objects which are limited. If you choose to
    keep limited equipment then you should stay mortal instead. Limited
    equipment is for mortals to fight over and earn, not for Immortals
    whom mortal players can never kill.

7)  If you are running a quest make sure you balance the prize(s). Do not 
    hand out anything that will upset the balance of the MUD.

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
    
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Do not ban a site without posting a note about why it was banned.
    Likewise do not unban a site without consulting other Immortals first.

REMEMBER : 
As an Immortal you have chosen to build and work on the mud. If you simply
want to play then stay mortal and enjoy the fun, but as an Immortal you
are expected to do certain duties and a minimum of building (you are also
supposed to have fun, but if that's all you want to do - sit and talk,
play around etc - then you should choose to be mortal and allow others to
immort and build).

These are the rules for Immortals to follow.

0 PK PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER

STEALING'~
.
Player Killing (PK) Rules:

Player killing and player stealing are allowed, and encouraged.
You will see a (PK) flag next to anyone you can attack -- you yourself
will always be in your own PK range. There are no concrete rules 
regarding PK; however, cabals may impose rules on members to restrict
certain actions such as ganging.

See also: 'MURDER'
~

0 RULES~
-------------------------------Rules of KBK--------------------------------

1) Don't spam. More specifically, don't spam communication channels, prays, or
commands.

2) Roleplaying is not enforced or required; however, you are required to act
within the in-game requirements of your cabal.

3) Multi-play is NOT allowed. If you are caught multi-playing you will be denied.
     The following actions are considered multi-playing:
       * Playing more than one character at one time.
       * Passing equipment between your own characters.
       * Using one of your characters to perform a task for another.

4) Drop linking to avoid dying, especially in a PK situation, is against the
game rules.

5) Placing a bounty on someone with one character then soon after killing them
with your Bounty is against the rules, and probably under consideration for
violation of Rule 3.

6) The decision of an Immortal is final. Starting an argument with an Immortal
won't get you anywhere. If you're having trouble with an Immortal 52-59, try
talking to an Imp (60).

7) Do not hoard limited items that you don't need. If you carry too many highly
limited items and don't use them, all of your equipment will be purged.

8) Don't advertise for other MUDs here, especially on the global channel. Doing
so will result in an instant siteban.

9) Because RP is not enforced, it is left up to the playerbase to govern
themselves as far as general communication goes. If you feel someone is being
excessively obscene/racist/vulgar, please contact an Immortal.

10) Not every minor rule is listed here. If you are told to stop doing something
by an Immortal, stop doing it or you will be punished.

11) Abuse of bugs, even minor ones, may result in your being denied, having an
ability taken away, or other such penalties.

Breaking these rules can result in your being slain, purged of your eq, denied,
or sitebanned.

If you think someone is breaking the rules, PRAY about it or note to IMMORTAL.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
The most populous species in the world, Humans are found in every walk

physically. Averaging 6'5" in height, Elves are fair skinned and have 
golden blonde to reddish to brown hair, and their eyes are usually 
green or blue (although there are some grey-eyed Elves). 
Elves are magical in nature, and it is rare to find an Elf who has 
forsworn magic. They are somewhat resistant to charm spells and 
other magic, but a strong spell can penetrate that resistance. Elves 
are difficult to locate and often walk unnoticed. Infravision allows 
them to see in the dark. Elves must stay good in order to keep their 
magical abilities. Elves who have turned to evil (even to neutrality) 
are frowned upon.

0 DARK-ELF DARKELF DARKELVES DARK~
Averaging 5'6", with ebony skin and stark white or silver hair, and eyes
that spark red with infravision (although there are a few who have 
lavender eyes), Dark-Elves are a species of renegade Elf who have turned
their energy toward evil. They are highly intelligent but not as studious
as Elves, and their nimbleness has been honed nearly to perfection through
generations of thievery and trouble-making. Like Elves, they can walk
unnoticed and are not easily locatable, and they are magical and resistant
to charm spells. Dark-Elves must remain evil to keep their magical
abilities. Dark-Elves who have turned to good (or neutrality) are frowned
upon.
~

0 GREY-ELF GREYELF GREYELVES GREY~
In physical appearance much like Elves, you really cannot tell them 
apart just by looking at them. Grey Elves came into being as the 
offspring of Elves and Dark-Elves, neither inherently good nor 
inherently evil. Such breeding was common practice during surface 
raids, a torture set upon female Elves by male Dark-Elves, and in 
some cases as a part of the torture of male Elves by female 
Dark-Elves (who after the breeding made a bloody sacrifice of the 
male Elves). Grey Elves average about 5'10" in height. It is as a 
result of their mixed heritage that Grey Elves have chosen not to 
follow the Light, nor to walk entirely in Shadow, but to move between 
the paths, seeking balance (although not always finding it). Grey 
Elves may be neutral only or risk losing their ability to cast magic. 
Grey Elves are highly intelligent and very wise, although not as
nimble as Dark-Elves, and are, for the most part, very likeable.
~

0 CENTAUR CENTAURS~
An offbreed species between 5'8" and 6'3" in height. They are half
man and half beast. Brute strength and raw power are their thing. 
They make good warriors (if you get past their infighting and 
other untrustworthy attributes). Centaurs are resistant to most
diseases and poisons. They excel in enhanced damage and bashing. 
All centaurs are good.
~

0 GIANT GIANTS STORM CLOUD FIRE~
These mighty people once lived in the mountains north of Thalos.
They lived by themselves in colonies and villages.  This was their way of
life until people started exploring and expanding into their lands.  The
ginats immediately took up arms against these people and tried to defend
the invasion.  The giants soon found themselves outnumbered by the humans
and other races invading their lands.  They gave up and accepted this new
way of life. Eventually groups of giants dispersed throughout Thera, and
they became just as "normal" as any other race.
         Giants are the largest sentient species in the land. They average 
around 1203' in height, although some have been sighted who are 27'  
tall. Due to their size, they tend to resist blows well. They excel at 
bashing and enhanced damage. Due to their size they are not good  swimmers
and cannot breathe under water easily.
~

0 TROLL TROLLS~
Used in stories to frighten children, in war stories to impress bar lasses
and as sources of humor in puppet shows, the troll is always a villain for
the "civilized" world.  Standing well over the tallest human, their
monstrous looks and unclean smell have earned them this image.
        Living in the high mountains, the troll has grown used to the cold
sterile air and dangerous heights.  Being some of the most hearty of many
of the races, few wounds ever are deep enough to cause long term damage to
a troll.  Though the fact brings much fear into human infantry, it is now
well known that fire and acid cause great damage to these creatures.
        Due to their nature, all trolls are evil.  And because of their
lack of proper learning, they are often to dull to become learned in the
ways of magely sorcery.  They are among the strongest of all the races,
and often the most deadly.
~

0 DRACONIAN DRAC DRACON~
Draconians are some of the foulest creatures that inhabit the planet. 
They scavenge bodies left on the battlefield for little trinkets or useful
items that they might wear. They are intelligent and strong but not very
fast. Some of the deadliest people to walk the land have been draconians
who have excelled in the ways of magic. Due to the wings on their back 
they are capable of flight. They are about 5' tall. They are resistant to
poison and disease. They must remain evil or risk losing all that they 
have learned.
~

0 GNOME GNOMES~
The smallest sentient species in the land, averaging 3' in height, 
Gnomes are usually pale grey to light brown skinned, and see in 
the dark with infravision. Tough, wiry little cretures, Gnomes 
live a long time and accumulate wisdom and knowledge. Resistant 
to poisons, they are vulnerable to bashing. Gnomes walk in all
paths, good, neutral, or evil.
~

0 ILLITHID ILLITHIDS~
An Illithid is a medium-sized humanoid with an octopuslike head, and
lengthly, tentacled hands. Known more for their incredibly ability with the
less martial, Illithids possess psionic abilities, are telepathic, and
possess a keen mind when it comes to the ways of magic. Their skin usually
ranges from a deep purple to the odd green, giving them an unwholesome alien
look. Their lunkish figures make them less adept in combat, but they are most
certainly some of the strongest minds in Thera.

Illithids, with such odd hands, are unable to make use of normal weapons and
shields, but instead use their tentacles in combat with good effect. Weak to
the pains of both light and fire, the mindflayer Illithids are quite
resistant to both magic and mental attacks, providing them with excellent
durability against other magely forces. 

These creatures, as scholarly and secretive as they are, are inclined to take
up the studies of necromancy, channeling and elementalism, dismissing the
more brutish classes as uncivilized and weak.
~

0 ETHEREAL~
Ethereals origins and species progression is unknown.  They do come from
another plane, possibly a wizard summoned them and lost control and they
started to reproduce on this plane.  They have no discernable body or
mass, simply a floating mist which makes them highly resistant to weapons
but electricity is a big weakness of theirs due to the water particles
present in their form.  They can fly and are some of the best minds in the
world.  They are more akin to mage professions than fighting.  They must
be good or neutral.
~

0 FORAGE~
Syntax: forage

Using their knowledge of the wilderness, a ranger is able to forage
for berries to eat.
~

0 'RANGER STAFF'~
Syntax: cast 'ranger staff'

Creates a powerful staff that a ranger can use to fight his or her
opponents with. It has a chance of healing in combat as well.
~

0 RANGER RANGERS~
Outdoorsmen, hunters, masters of woodcraft, Rangers are the guardians of
the forests.  In addition to having excellent fighting skills, they are
also wielders of some powerful magic.  Some Rangers have been known to
call large bears, lions, wolves and falcons to their aid, fashion mystical
staves, and be able to camouflage beyond detection.  Their ability to
ambush opponents makes them deadly foes.
~

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors live for the combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best 
fighters of all the current classes but lack the subtle skills that others
possess. They possess no magical talent whatsoever and rely on brute 
strength and combat know-how instead.

~

0 CHANNELERS CHANNELER~
Channelers are the local sponges, not a very outstanding title but one
which they bare with much pride. These select few have been chosen by
the gods to absorb the excess powers of the world and redirect them for
their use at their descrection. It has been said that a channeler can
stand face to face with a dragon and absorb his fireballs as if they
were not there, and then to shoot them back at the dragon with even more
power then they were originally formed.
~

0 NECROMANCER NECROMANCERS~
Wielders of black magic, they study the darkest and most hated of all of
the magical arts, that of giving life to something without any. In other words
raising the dead. It is said once a necro reaches a certain level of
efficiency with his spell weaving the dead themselves will heed his call.
~

0 ELEMENTALIST~
The elementalist seeks to harness and control the powerful forces
of earth, air, fire and water.  While lacking the sheer raw magical power
of the channeler, and the armies of servants of the necromancer, the
elementalist can tailor his powers to exploit the specific weaknesses of
the creatures of Thera.  The elementalist is the caller of earthquakes and
the summoner of tidal waves.  Truly adept elementalists can call upon
creatures from the elemental planes to serve them.
~

0 MONK MONKS~
Monks are martial artists dedicated to the understanding of
the body and the perfection of it into total control. Monks are adept
at unarmed combat and lose much of their skill when using weapons.
   A monk who fights hand to hand can get up to fourth attack,
but lose the ability to hit with third and fourth attacks when using
weapons. All monks are lawful due to their strict regime of meditation
and martial arts parctice. They can be either good or neutral.

~

0 ANTI-PALADIN ANTI-PALADINS ANTIPALADIN ANTIPALADINS ANTI~
Little is known about the origin of the Anti-Paladins. However, it is 
clear that they came (in force) into the world shortly after the rise 
of the Paladins. It is rumored that these warriors of chaos and evil 
were traitor paladins, children trained by demons, or possibly even
demons themselves.

There have been those who have claimed to learn the secrets of these
"anti-paladins", but this is all most would reveal: It is said the
guild of Legion (which is claimed to be the true name of the AP's guild)
is similar to that of the monks. Young men and women of all races come
to the guilds in hope of learning to better themselves and harming the
world. Through years of training, the Legionaires learned to embrace
the ways of chaos and evil. It is this mindframe that allows them to 
unleash their dangerous magics upon Thera. There are stories that tell
of those who have left the guild to lead more peaceful lives, and found
themselves unable to use their former magics, their powerful skills, 
and even unable to walk or speak. 

It is unknown if these stories are true or false, however, one thing is 
clear. These mage-warriors want nothing more than the destruction of all
that does belong to them and their guild.  
~

0 PALADIN PALADINS~
These warriors have chosen the path of virtue and chivalry above all others. 
This dedication to their cause grants them priest-like spells and healing
powers.  They are also formidable fighters, always questing to stamp out
evil. Paladins must stay good in order to cast their spells.  Those who
forsake goodness are frowned upon.  Paladins are expected to be truthful,
chivalrous, humble, merciful, kind, bold, and noble of spirit.  Paladins
must be Lawful Good.
~

0 HOMETOWN HOME TOWN~
You must now choose your hometown. This is the town which you will
recall to when using Word of Recall, or whenever you die. Midgaard
allows all alignments, while Ofcol allows good only, New Thalos allows
neutral only, and Arkham allows evil only.
            
New players should choose Midgaard as it is most central and commonly
populated.
~

0 AGE~
Aging is just that, a character getting older. In Tartarus your
characters will age slowly as you spend time exploring the world. The age
at which you die will vary depending on your race (the biggest factor),
your constitution and a small random factor.

When you eventually die of old age you will expire permanently. Immortals
may be able to increase your lifespan if quests are undertaken.

Expect a human to live for around 400 hours of real time, other races are
variations on that, with some longer (elves are almost double), and some a
little shorter.

and anathema. 
~

0 PATHFINDING~
Syntax: automatic

As a result of considerable time and experience in the wilds, Sylvans gain
the natural ability to navigate forests, hills, and mountains much more
efficiently than others. 

The beneficial effects of this skill increase as the Sylvan's mastery of the
skill increases.
~

0 EVALUATION~
Syntax: evaluation

This lets you get a more detailed look at a victim's current state of
health. Using evaluation you will be able to gauge better how wounded a
foe is (provided you figure out what the stages of injury are represented
by). If you fail an evaluation check your skill will improve but you will
have to start re-evaluating again to turn it back on.
~

0 LIFELINE~
Syntax: cast lifeline <target>

Creates and ethereal line between the caster and a target. Casting it
without any argument results in the caster being transported to the
previously lifeline target. If a caster lifelines themself the line is
severed from the previous target. It is a Life spell.

A victim may 'nofollow' to cut a lifeline that is unwanted.
~

0 SAFETY~
Syntax: cast safety

Recalls all members of the casters group who are in the same room. It is a

~

0 'ANIMATE DEAD' 'MUMMIFY' 'ANIMATE SKELETON' ANIMATE DECAY 'DECAY CORPSE'

EMBALM SOULBIND SOUL~
Syntax: cast 'animate dead' corpse
	cast 'animate skeleton' skeleton
	cast mummify corpse
	cast decay corpse
	cast preserve corpse
 	cast soulbind <target>

These are the basis of a necromancer's power. Decay corpse strips the
flesh off a corpse and leaves the skeletal remains. The skeleton may then
be animated using the 'animate skeleton' spell.

Corpses that are still intact may be animated with the more powerful
animate dead spell, or, at much higher levels, raised as mummies with the
mummify spell.

'Embalm' skill will preserve a corpse and extend the duration before a
it decays to dust.

In all cases of animates the undead raised will have a level of power
comparable to it's living existence but slightly lowered. Thus an orc
zombie won't be as powerful as a demon zombie. Skeletons are weaker than
zombies, which are in turn weaker than mummies. The number of undead you
can raise is level dependant and also modified by the type of undead you
already have following you.

Soulbind will bind an undead follower to your soul and it will act as a
loyal pet, entering and leaving the realms with you like a normal pet.

direction is given you will attempt to travel one room in the first
direction, then change path and go to the next room via the second
direction. This is most useful in rushing past tracking mobs or aggressive
ones that are blocking the way.
~

0 'DOOR BASH'~
Syntax: door <direction>

Attempt to bash down a door using brute force. A giant, centaur and troll
ability. Failing can cause harm, and usually a successful bashing will
result in the basher flying into the next room.

Syntax: cast 'lesser golem'
	cast 'greater golem'
	cast preserve <object>

A necromancer may create a lesser golem by gathering body parts and then
forming them into a flesh automaton. The power of the golem is dependant
on the caster's level and the number of parts. The 'preserve' spell is
used to keep body parts such as hearts, arms, legs and heads from
decaying. 

Greater golem fashions a more powerful golem to serve and requires no
material components to cast.

0 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the
release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)
~

0 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

52 JOBS~
This is a partial list of what a god of any given level should be doing. It is
not complete yet.

Angels:(52-54)
Angels and higher level gods may not assist mortals directly in any way.  
An Angel's main job is to help with quests (via switch), or possibly run
small quest of their own -- but the rewards should be minimal.

Deities:(55-56)
Deities have two main roles: reimbursement and quest running.  Be skeptical
on reimburses, don't just hand out every piece of gear.  I suggest limiting
reimbursements to 10 items at a time, and make sure that you do not load things
at too high a level (new format items have hard-coded levels, so are not a
problem).  vnum and stat are useful for this.  You can draft Angels to help you
run a quest, and please note that quests should NOT have huge rewards -- the
main point should be to have fun.  Deities have no business trying to enforce
rules -- the most you should do to a player is a NOCHANNEL or similar light
punishment.

Gods:(57-59)
Gods can run quests just like Deities, and it's nice to do reimbursements too.
However, the main role of a God is keeping the peace.  Gods can enforce (but
not create) rules, using the various NOTELL-class commands, as well as deny,
purge, freeze, and ban (but be careful with these commands!)  Gods are expected
to help make the mud run more smoothly, power trips are strictly verbotten.

Not fulfilling the roles of your office can result in demotion or deletion.
~

0 DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~

52 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
Syntax: <skills/spells>

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~

0 OUTFIT~
Syntax: outfit 

The outfit command is useable by those still in their newbie hours to
acquire a basic set of equipment to begin the game with. It affects all
empty equipment slots.
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassist: makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~

0 CABAL CABALS~
KBK offers the following Cabals to mortals:

  Ancient ..... Masters of Intrigue

~

0 HEALER~
Healers are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, healers are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they posess an impressive array of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.
~

0 THIEF~
Thieves are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  Thieves are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than 
healers, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.
~

0 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON AXE DAGGER FLAIL MACE POLEARM SPEAR SWORD WHIP~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.

both his weapon and his opponent's.

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Syntax: automatic

Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block. Beware, flails ignore 
shield blocking attempts, and whips have an easier time getting around them.  
Shields of low caliber can be cleaved by opponents. 
~

0 BACKSTAB~
Syntax: backstab <victim>

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.
The use of the Backstab skill requires a dagger. The damage inflicted by a 
backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his dagger skill, his backstab 
skill, and the power of his opponent. Only thieves may learn to backstab.
~

0 BASH~
Syntax: bash <victim>
	bash

The bash skill is a brute-force attack designed to knock your foe to his knees.  
Its success depends on many factors, including the bash rating, your weight, 
and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon is not generally a wise idea.
~

0 BERSERK~
Syntax: berserk

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Use of the berserk skill also heals the warrior slightly.
~

0 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
Syntax: dirt <victim>
	dirt

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  
The blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  
Dexterity helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and 
thieves may learn this skill.
~

0 DISARM~
Syntax: disarm

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. 
~

0 DODGE~
Syntax: automatic

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target. 
~

0 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Syntax: automatic

Certain classes can become skilled enough in combat that they are able to 
inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked for with 
each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus is very 
low.
~

0 ENVENOM~
Syntax: envenom <object>

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill designed to win a battle through alchemy 
and treachery rather than skill or strength. Or, put another way, it's a skill 
used by the smart to kill the foolish. Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, 
with varying effects. Poisoned food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the 
consumer, and is unlikely to be more than a minor inconvenience (after all, the 
typical adventurer could drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A 
poisoned weapon, on the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent 
as the poison  burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom 
evaporates quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.

See also: 'POISON'
~

0 'HAND TO HAND'~
Syntax: automatic

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning this
style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare hands.
However, defensive capabilities are mostly crippled due to the lack of the
PARRY ability to defend oneself, so most combatants may find themselves 
unwilling to use this form of fighting unless they are a specialist, an assassin,
or a monk.
~

0 KICK~
Syntax: kick

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. 
~

0 PARRY~
Syntax: automatic

attacks, and is successful more often than dodge. The best chance of parrying 
occurs when the defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

0 RESCUE~
Syntax: rescue <target>

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. 
~

0 TRIP~
Syntax: trip <victim>
	trip

Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves using any one of a number of
methods to bring your opponent down to the ground, stunning them. Tripping large 
monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will find the attack easy to 
avoid.
~

0 'SECOND ATTACK'~
Syntax: automatic

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at an additional strike
in combat -- a perfected second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round. 
~

0 'THIRD ATTACK'~

in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well.  Perfect
third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.

Syntax: hide
	sneak

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used to move from room to room
undetected. These skills may be used in conjunction to remain hidden while
moving.
~

0 'FAST HEALING'~
Syntax: automatic

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,

of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object
concerning its power and uses.
~

0 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
Syntax: automatic

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely. 
~

0 PEEK~
Syntax: look <target>

The Peek skill can be used to view a victim's inventory. It must be used
in conjunction with the 'LOOK' command.

See also: 'LOOK'

intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Certain locks are
impossible to pick.

peril.
~

0 RECHARGE~
Syntax: cast recharge <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell

Syntax: cast demonfire <victim>
	cast demonfire

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those

inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~

0 'RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

0 'HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
on the target, causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious 
burns in the process. This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune 
to fire.
~

0 'HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a healer's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy) might and cursed.  The healer suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality. 
~

0 FRENZY~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

0 CALM~
Syntax: cast calm

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master healer is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

0 HASTE~
Syntax: cast haste <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack in combat, and improving evasive abilities in combat.  
However, it produces a great strain on the system, such that recuperative 
abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating the slow spell. 

See also: 'SLOW'
~

0 SLOW~
Syntax: cast slow <victim>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with its own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also double movement costs and healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism. However, targets of a Slow cast attempt will
find themselves angered and strike the caster unless sleeping.

See also: 'HASTE'
~

0 'FOURTH ATTACK'~
Syntax: automatic

True masters of combat, warriors are able to achieve a chance to land
a fourth attack per round. This skill improves the chances to land a second

attack every round.

See also: 'DUAL WIELD'
~
0 PLAGUE~
Syntax: cast plague <victim>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

0 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not

viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.

all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~

0 MASS HEALING~

on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

0 FIREPROOF~
Syntax: cast fireproof <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~

0 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.

would get normally and does not set the PC or NPC's number of attacks TO the
specified value.
~

1 PROTECTED CITIES LAW LAWS~
The protected cities are defined as: Midgaard, New Thalos, Arkham, Tar Valon.

1) Any attack, direct or indirect, is against the law, and will result in the
placement of a warrant.

- An attack is defined as:
 1.1 * An offensive command or ability.
 1.2 * Any attempt to render a victim unconscious.
 1.3 * Theft from another player.
 1.4 * Summoning of another player into an aggressive creature.
 1.5 * Any combat provoking ability.

2) Assault against Special Guards, whether in a protected area or not, is 
considered an attack against the Enforcer Cabal and constitutes a warrant.

3) Giving an aid (including combat help, healing, etc) to a criminal while they
are being perused by an Enforcer will result in a warrant.

4) Looting another player's corpse within a protected city is illegal. Players
may take things from members of THE SAME CABAL without repercussions.

 4.1 * Law #4 is carried over to include the looting of any charmed mob killed
under the control of a player in a protected city.

5) Assault against the Enforcer Hideout itself is justification for a a warrant.

6) Any Enforcer is considered exempt from the above regulations when an 
otherwise breech of these laws is against a criminal, and does not do harm to
any non-criminal.

NOTE: IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENFORCER CABAL TO REGULATE THE PROTECTED
CITIES AND ENFORCER THE ABOVE MANDATES. IT IS NOT IT'S PURPOSE TO COLLECT THE
EQUIPMENT OF SLAIN CRIMINALS FOR IT'S MEMBERS BENEFIT. THE LOOTING OF CRIMINALS
SHOULD BE LIMITED TO WHAT IS NECISARRY TO PROHIBIT THEM FROM MOUNTING AN 
EFFECTIVE, IMMEDIATE REPRISAL.

With the Plant Explosives skill, a master thief is able to stealthily plant an
explosive device camouflaged as a run-of-the-mill sword or dagger on a victim.

sets the timer for. Rightfully, characters who notice this will be somewhat
offended.
~

1 'ADVANCED TRIPWIRE'~
Syntax: automatic

With the Advanced Tripwire skill, a master thief is able to improve their
ordinary tripwire abilities profoundly. No longer must he choose between
high or low tripwires, as ingenious placing of the traps produces results

upgraded to cause significant harm, in addition to simply stunning the
victim.

1 'ARMOR CLASS' AC ARMOR~

Since the dawn of time, man and beast alike have sought ways to protect
themselves from harm through artificial means. Armor class is the protective 
rating of a piece or set of equipment. Armor can protect against weapon 
attacks such as bashing, slashing, and piercing, as well as magic attacks 
such as fire, ice, lightning, and so forth. The amount of effectiveness of 
armor is relatively simple; it reduces damage linearly as your armor 
class increases.
~

1 HITROLL DAMROLL~

Damroll is a measure of potency added to physical attacks and certain 
special skills. The higher the damroll, the better.

Hitroll has a hand in your odds to dodge, parry, or otherwise use your skills to
avoid attacks. Hitroll calculations are made based on your hitroll versus
your opponent's hitroll. A victim gains no benefit if his attacker's
hitroll is higher than his. Note that this means it also judges your odds to land
attacks, since an opponent with more hitroll will avoid attacks that might
have otherwise landed. Thus, it is never a bad idea to stay ahead of the game
in terms of accuracy granted by hitroll. The higher the hitroll, the
better.
~

1 REGENERATION REGEN~

Regeneration is the ability of a character to regenerate slowly over time.
This is opposed to tick-based regeneration, which occur only when ticks happen.
Regeneration heals the character for a random value between 1 and his 
regeneration stat on every combat pulse, whether or not that character is
in combat. Thus, it serves as both a form of healing, and a short-run form of
increasing effective maximum health.
~

1 MAELSTROM~
Syntax: cast 'maelstrom' <target>

A master elementalist is capable of unleashing an elemental maelstrom upon a
victim, rendering their body completely unable to defend itself against the

will bypass immunities and resistances, and will be treated as vulnerabilities.
~

1 'BASTION OF ELEMENTS'~
Syntax: cast 'bastion of elements' <target>

A master elementalist is capable of using his expertise in the elements to summon
all known elemental shields at once upon an ally. The extra strain on the
elementalist to summon the shields at the same time results in a reduced duration.

          LIGHTNING' 'SHIELD OF WIND' 'SHIELD OF FROST'
~

1 HURRICANE~

room, causing all players in the room except himself and his target to be removed

vicinity.
~

1 'SHATTER ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'shatter armor' <target>

A master elementalist is capable of using his mastery of the elements to shatter

52 OLC MEDIT REDIT AEDIT OEDIT~
Hello builders. {RPlease read through this file before you start churning out
items for players in your areas.{x The purpose of this file is to keep item
balance in check. Most stats and values are self-explanatory, but some are a
little more involved and require some explanation:

Dammod - this stat affects the damage that a character or mob takes. Examples:
1 dammod means the character takes 1% more damage. -1 dammod means the character
takes 1% less damage. Dammod is additive. If a player has 4 items with -5 dammod
each, he takes 20% less damage. This means that it is completely possible for a
character to take 0 damage (100% reduction). If dammod gets too high, combat becomes
trivialized since no one takes damage. This is a gamebreaker. This stat should 
rarely be on any item. If 3 builders see this stat and decide to put 2 items each in
their areas, that's already 6 items with reduced damage. Someone can easily get all 6
and become nearly immune. This stat can be placed on mobs to portray high resistance 
to damage and in doing so is fair game.

Wealth - this stat has no purpose right now, and maybe be used for something in the
future. Gold drops from mobs have been changed to be calculated as a function of level 
and other variables, not predefined numbers.

EnhancedDamMod - this stat affects the damage taht a character or mob deals. Examples:
1 EDM means the character deals 1% more damage. -1 EDM means the character deals 1%
less damage. For the same reasons as dammod, this stat should be kept to an absolute
minimum unless HP values skyrocket and more damage is necessary to compensate. This stat can 
be placed on mobs to portray great strength and in doing so is fair game.

AttackMod - this stat affects a characters number of attacks per combat round. Only
positive values are valid. For the same reasons as dammod, this stat should be kept
to an absolute minimum. This can get very spammy and annoying if out of control. This 
stat can be placed on mobs to portray high speed and in doing so is fair game.

Armor (AC) - AC damage reduction is based on an internal constant X per 1% damage.
Thus, if a character has 10 x X armor, he takes 10% less damage. Use of this
is more liberal than it is for dammod, enhanceddammod, and attackmod, but 
should still be kept within reason. 

Regen - Every combat round, whether or not a character is in combat, he will recover
between 1 and his Regen stat HP. If there is too much of this stat, a character can
be made just as invincible or frustrating as with the dammod method. Since there is
a degree of uncertainty with regard to this stat, more liberal use is allowed. However,
the restrictions are still there. Keep this stat in moderation. This stat can be placed
on mobs, but is only really viable if your intention is to annoy players; if you want
a weird regenerating lizard-type mob, it's better just to code a prog for it than to
have the player wonder why the hell he keeps going back to "perfect health" from "few
scratches".
~

1 EARTHMAW~
Syntax: cast 'earthmaw' <target>

1 SMOKE~
Syntax: cast 'smoke' <target>

An elementalist is capable of blowing smoke into the face of a target, possibly blinding
them.
~

1 QUEST 'QUEST CREDITS'~

Quest credits are used to purchase special rewards that aren't normally attainable. The
rewards can be seen using REDEEM LIST at the Temple Altar in Midgaard, and range from
removal of vulnerabilities, to consumables, to class-specific equipment. Quest credits
can be earned primarily by killing other players and secondarily by killing certain
strong mobs or raiding cabal hideouts, though the former is significantly more profitable
than the latter.

~

1 'WARD OF MAGNETISM'~
Syntax: cast 'ward of magnetism'

This spell surrounds a Channeler with an invisible ward of magnetic energy. Incoming blows
from weapons made of metal will be repelled by the invisible force, acting much like parry
or dodge. The weight of the weapon and the strength of the attacker play a noticeable part
in the success of the spell.
~

1 AURA~
Syntax: cast aura <target>
        commune aura <target>

This spell surrounds the target with a protective aura, reducing damage taken.
~

1 ROT~
Syntax: cast rot <target>

health over time, and is potentially fatal if the victim is one of low constitution.
