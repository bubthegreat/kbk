NAME   The Town Square~
DESCR
You stand in the bustling town square of Turgon, a small village nestled
in the shadow of the Red Dragon's mountain. Cobblestone streets radiate
outward in all directions. A weathered fountain sits in the center, its
water long since dried up. The village inn lies to the north, while the
general store is to the east. A narrow alley leads south, and the town
gate stands to the west.
